                <p data-aos="zoom-in" class="btn btn-outline-dark"> </br>Mountaineering is the set of outdoor
                    activities
                    that involves
                    ascending tall
                    mountains.
                    Mountaineering-related activities include traditional outdoor climbing, skiing and
                    traversing via
                    ferratas.Indoor climbing, sport climbing and bouldering are also considered variants of
                    mountaineering by
                    some. Unlike most sports, mountaineering lacks widely applied formal rules, regulations, and
                    governance;
                    mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing
                    mountains.
                    Numerous
                    local
                    alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities. A federation
                    of alpine
                    clubs,
                    the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA), is the International
                    Olympic
                    Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing

                    Humans have been present in mountains since prehistory. The remains of Ötzi, who lived in
                    the 4th
                    millennium
                    BC, were found in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps. However,
                    the highest mountains were rarely visited early on, and were often associated with
                    supernatural or
                    religious
                    concepts. Nonetheless,
                    there are many documented examples of people climbing mountains prior to the formal
                    development of
                    the sport
                    in the 19th century, although many of these stories are sometimes considered fictional or
                    legendary.[citation
                    needed]
                    The famous poet Petrarch describes his 26 April 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux (1,912 m (6,273
                    ft)) in
                    one of
                    his epistolae familiares, claiming to be inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount
                    Haemo.
                    For most of antiquity, climbing mountains was a practical or symbolic activity, usually
                    undertaken
                    for
                    economic, political, or religious purposes. A commonly cited example is the 1492 ascent of
                    Mont
                    Aiguille
                    (2,085 m (6,841 ft)) by Antoine de Ville,
                    a French military officer and lord of Domjulien and Beaupré.In the Andes, around the late
                    1400s and
                    early
                    1500s many ascents were made of extremely high peaks by the Incas and their subjects. The
                    highest
                    they are
                    known for crtain to have climbed is 6739m at the summit of Volcan Llullaillaco

                <p data-aos="zoom-in" class="btn btn-outline-dark"> Alpine style, or informal variations of it, is
                    the
                    most common form of
                    mountaineering
                    today. It involves a single, straightforward climb of the mountain, with no backtracking.
                    This style
                    is most
                    suited for medium-sized mountain areas close to civilization with elevations of 2,000–5,000
                    m
                    (6,600–16,400
                    ft), such as the Alps or the Rocky Mountains. Alpine style ascents have been done throughout
                    history
                    on
                    extreme altitude (above 5,000 m) peaks also, albeit in lower volume to expedition style
                    ascents.
                    Climbers
                    generally carry their loads between camps without backtracking, in a single push for the
                    summit. If
                    the
                    summit
                    is reachable from the base camp or trailhead within one day, then alpine-style mountaineers
                    will not
                    change
                    camps at all, and only carry the slightest of loads (necessary nourishment and equipment) up
                    to the
                    summit.
                    "Light and fast" is the mantra of the alpine mountaineer.
                    Climbers climb the route only once because they do not continually climb up and down to
                    stock camps
                    with
                    supplies
                    Fewer supplies are used on the climb, therefore fewer personnel are needed
                    Alpine-style ascents do not leave the climber exposed to objective hazards as long as an
                    expedition-style
                    climb does; however, because of the speed of the ascent relative to an expedition-style
                    climb there
                    is less
                    time for acclimatization
                    For the highest mountains, supplemental oxygen is rarely used, or used more sparingly.
                    Danger of being trapped at high altitude due to storms, potentially being exposed to HAPE or
                    HACE
                    Lower capital expenditures and a shorter time scale</p>

                <p data-aos="zoom-in" class="btn btn-outline-dark"> The alpine style contrasts with "expedition
                    style".
                    With this style,
                    climbers
                    will
                    carry
                    large amounts of equipment and provisions up and down the mountain, slowly making upward
                    progress.
                    Climbing in an expedition style is preferred if the summit is very high or distant from
                    civilization.
                    Mountaineers who use this style are usually, but not always, part of a large team of
                    climbers and
                    support
                    staff (such as porters and guides). To cover large distances with their massive amounts of
                    gear,
                    sleds and
                    pack animals are commonly used. Climbers will set up multiple camps along the mountain, and
                    will
                    haul their
                    gear up the mountain multiple times, returning to a lower camp after each haul until all the
                    gear is
                    at a
                    higher camp; and repeating this procedure until they reach the summit. This technique is
                    also
                    helpful for
                    acclimatization.[31] While it is the original style in which high mountains were climbed,
                    expedition style is rare these days as more mountains have become accessible to the general
                    public
                    with air
                    travel and the penetration of highways into mountainous regions. It is still common in
                    ranges such
                    as the
                    Alaska Range and the Himalayas.
                    Uses multiple trips between camps to carry supplies up to higher camps
                    Group sizes are often larger than alpine style climbs because more supplies are carried
                    between
                    camps
                    Fixed lines are often used to minimize the danger involved in continually moving between
                    camps
                    For the highest mountains, supplemental oxygen is frequently used
                    There is a higher margin of safety in relation to equipment, food, time, and ability to wait
                    out
                    storms at
                    high camps
                    Avoidance of being trapped in storms at high altitudes and being forced to descend in
                    treacherous
                    avalanche
                    conditions
                    Possible higher exposure to objective hazards such as avalanches or rockfall, due to slower
                    travel
                    times

                <p data-aos="zoom-in" class="btn btn-outline-dark">Alpine rock climbing involves technical skills
                    including the ability to
                    place anchors into the rock
                    to
                    safely
                    ascend a mountain. In some cases, climbers may have to climb multiple pitches of rock to
                    reach the
                    top.
                    Typically, for any one pitch, there is a belayer who is stationary and creates tension on
                    the rope
                    to catch
                    a
                    climber should he or she fall, and a climber who ascends the rock. The first climber, called
                    the
                    leader,
                    will
                    reach a point on the rock and then build an anchor, which will secure subsequent climbers.
                    Anchors
                    could be
                    created by using slings around a tree or boulder, or by using protection devices like cams
                    and nuts.

                    Once anchored, the leader will then belay the climber coming up from below. Once the
                    follower
                    reaches the
                    leader, the leader will often transfer all necessary protection devices (known as a rack) to
                    the
                    follower.
                    The
                    follower then becomes the leader and will ascend the next pitch. This process will continue
                    until
                    the
                    climbers
                    either reach the top, or run into different terrain.

                    For extremely vertical rocks, or to overcome certain logistical challenges, climbers may use
                    aid
                    climbing
                    techniques. This involves the use of equipment, such as ladders, fixed lines, and ascenders
                    to help
                    the
                    climber push themself up the rock.

                    In alpine climbing, it is common for climbers to see routes of mixed terrain. This means
                    climbers
                    may need
                    to
                    move efficiently from climbing glacier, to rock, to ice, back and forth in a number of
                    variations

                    provide
                    additional traction on hard snow and ice. For loose snow, crampons are less suitable, and

                    Climbers use a few different forms of shelter depending on the situation and conditions.
                    Shelter is a very important aspect of safety for the climber as weather in the mountains may
                    be very unpredictable. Tall mountains may require many days of camping.

                    Short trips lasting less than a day generally do not require shelter, although for safety,
                    most mountaineers will carry an emergency shelter, such a light bivouac sack

                    Typical shelters used for camping include tents and bivouac sacks. The ability of these
                    shelters to provide protection from the elements is dependent on their design. Mountaineers
                    who climb in areas with cold weather or snow and ice will use more heavy-duty shelters than
                    those who climb in more forgiving environments.
                    In remote locations, mountaineers will set up a "base camp", which is an area used for
                    staging attempts at nearby summits. Base camps are positioned to be relatively safe from
                    harsh terrain and weather. Where the summit cannot be reached from base camp in a single
                    day, a mountain will have additional camps above base camp. For popular mountains, base
                    camps may be at a fixed location and become famous. The Everest base camps and Camp Muir are
                    among the most famous base camps

                    Camping is not always an option, or may not be suitable if a mountain is close to
                    civilization. Some regions may legally prohibit primitive camping due to concern for the
                    environment, or due to issues with crowds. In lieu of camping, mountaineers may choose to
                    stay in mountain huts
                    When open and manned, the huts are generally run by full-time employees, but some are
                    staffed on a voluntary basis by members of alpine clubs. The manager of the hut, termed a
                    guardian or warden in Europe, will usually also sell refreshments and meals, both to those
                    visiting only for the day and to those staying overnight. The offering is surprisingly wide,
                    given that most supplies, often including fresh water, must be flown in by helicopter, and
                    may include glucose-based snacks (such as candy bars) on which climbers and walkers wish to
                    stock up, cakes and pastries made at the hut, a variety of hot and cold drinks (including
                    beer and wine), and high carbohydrate dinners in the evenings. Not all huts offer a catered
                    service, though, and visitors may need to provide for themselves. Some huts offer facilities
                    for both, enabling visitors wishing to keep costs down to bring their own food and cooking
                    equipment and to cater using the facilities provided. Booking for overnight stays at huts is
                    deemed obligatory, and in many cases is essential as some popular huts, even with more than
                    100 bed spaces, may be full during good weather and at weekends. Once made, the cancellation
                    of a reservation is advised as a matter of courtesy – and, indeed, potentially of safety, as
                    many huts keep a record of where climbers and walkers state they plan to walk to next.
                    Most huts may be contacted by telephone and most take credit cards as a means of payment

                    Where conditions permit, snow caves are another way to shelter high on the mountain. Some
                    climbers do not use tents at high altitudes unless the snow conditions do not allow for snow
                    caving, since snow caves are silent and much warmer than tents. They can be built relatively
                    easily, given sufficient time, using a snow shovel. The temperature of a correctly made snow
                    cave will hover around freezing, which relative to outside temperatures can be very warm.
                    They can be dug anywhere where there is at least four feet of snow. The addition of a good
                    quality bivouac bag and closed cell foam sleeping mat will also increase the warmth of the
                    snow cave. Another shelter that works well is a quinzee, which is excavated from a pile of
                    snow that has been work hardened or sintered (typically by stomping). Igloos are used by
                    some climbers, but are deceptively difficult to build and require specific snow conditions
